## Description

Organize your [TZe tape cartridges](https://store.brother.de/verbrauchsmaterial/tze-baender) for the [Brother P-Touch series](https://store.brother.de/etiketten-und-belegdrucker/p-touch-beschriftungsgeraete) of label printers so that they slide on horizontal [Multipoint](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints) rails.

This pack includes containers for the following cartridges:

* TZe 12mm (and smaller)
* TZe 18mm
* TZe 24mm
* TZe 36mm

The containers are equipped with slots to slide onto the [Multipoint](https://www.multiboard.io/parts-library/multipoint/multipoints) rail system. You can mount them on a [Multiboard](https://www.multiboard.io/) or directly on a wall without a Multiboard.
